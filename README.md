CopaAnalyzer: Unveiling the next Copa America Champion with ML

In the heart of every passionate football enthusiast lies an insatiable desire to witness the beautiful game's unpredictable drama unfold on the grandest stages. As an Argentine, my love for football runs deep, particularly when the pride of my nation takes center stage, led by the GOAT Lionel Messi. The 2022 World Cup victory only fueled my passion and sparked a new endeavorâ€”to create a predictive model that forecasts the next Copa America champion.

CopaAnalyzer utilizes logistic regression to peer into the forthcoming tournament's outcome. Drawing from three primary data sources (historical games data since 2020, FIFA rankings, and team skill) this model aims to unravel the intricacies of South American football dynamics.

This project serves as the culmination of my journey through a data analytics boot camp, showcasing the application of tools and techniques acquired along the way. From data wrangling to model evaluation, each step reflects a commitment to harnessing the power of data to unlock footballing insights.

Join me as we dive into the realm of CopaAnalyzer, where analytics meets anticipation, and together, let's celebrate the enduring magic of football.

Let the ball start rolling!
